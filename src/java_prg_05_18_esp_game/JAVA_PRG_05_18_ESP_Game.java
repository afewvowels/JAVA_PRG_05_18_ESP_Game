/**
 *
 * @author bluebackdev
 * Write a program that tests your ESP (extrasensory perception). The program
 * should randomly select the name of a color from the following list of words:
 * 
 *      Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow
 * 
 * To select a word, the program can generate a random number. For example, if
 * the number is 0, the selected word is Red; if the number is 1, the selected
 * word is Green; and so forth.
 * 
 * Next, the program should ask the user to enter the color that the computer
 * has selected. After the user has entered his or her guess, the program should
 * display the name of the randomly selected color. The program should repeat
 * this 10 times and then display the number of times the user correctly
 * guessed the selected color. Be sure to modularize the program into methods
 * that perform each major task.
